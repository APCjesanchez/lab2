    Age: 19 <br><br>

    Birthdate: July 16, 2003<br><br>

    Senior High School Graduated From? Asia Pacific College<br><br>

    Course: BSCS â€“ Cyber Security & Forensics<br><br>

    Scholarship? Yes, If yes, %? APC Loyalty Discount 2019 (20%)<br><br>

    Transferee / Second Course? No <br><br>

    Did you choose this course? Yes <br><br>

    Why Yes? Since we are approaching a technological evolution, I believed that not only will it bring benefits but also detriments, therefore, I approached this course as my go-to because we will be 
    in demand by the time, we have finished our college to against the detriments like black hat hackers.<br><br>

    I.T. Experience: Beginner Level Python Programming, Exposure to Video Games since Childhood<br><br>

    Hobbies / Interests: Play games, watching Anime, watching Horror movies, reading manga/manhwa, watching extra courses for my LinkedIn<br><br>

    Goals in life: To be able to own many small businesses and to handle many of the websites that are going to be specific for each small business. To have enough money and business to enjoy retirement with my 
    own family.<br><br>

    What do you expect to learn from this course (Web Programming)? To be able to flexibly use HTML, CSS, and many other programming languages for making websites and to reignite and to further improve the skills 
    we had used during the bootcamp. <br><br>

    What do you want to learn to help you in your chosen Major? I want to learn how to handle algorithms and datasets much better since these are the core of any program and the ones most likely to be attacked 
    but being able to handle websites is good as well because these are the ones visited and tested against when black hats are targeting the company. <br><br>

    Any other interesting aspects of your life that you would like to share?<br><br>
    Well, I am generally a very hardworking student, but I have to flip a switch somewhere in my brain and if it flips, I get to work so productively as long as no one bothers me, which is unlikely due to 
    spontaneous chores.<br><br>

    Add one or more pictures about yourself and your interests that you would like to share for your introduction.<br><br>
